# Monte Carlo
Is used to approximate intervals by using sample averages.


# Example
We want to approximate the integral $\int_0^1 e^{-x} = 1 - 1/e = 0.6321206$. 

We do the following:
1. draw from a $uniform(0, 1)$ distribution since $0, 1$ are the boundaries of the integral.
1. plugin the samples into $f(x) = e^{-x}$.
1. average.
```{r}
f = function(x) {
  return(exp(-x))
}

s = runif(10^6, 0, 1)

transformed = sapply(s, f)
mean(transformed)
```
